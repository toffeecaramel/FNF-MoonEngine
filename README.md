<h1 align="center">• Welcome to Moon Engine! • </h1>
<h3 align="center">A FNF engine based on Forever Engine!</h3>

----------------------------------------------

<h1 align="center">• INSTALLATION GUIDE • </h1>

## Step 1: Installing Flixel.
* Let's start by downloading the game engine.
    - Download [the latest haxe version](https://haxe.org)
    - Then, download [the latest git version](https://www.git-scm.com)

## Step 2: Downloading the project.
* Now, Let's clone the repository.
    - Open your Command Prompt by typing CMD on windows search.
    - Run `cd directory/of/your/desire` so the cmd runs the commands on such folder.
    - For example, doing `cd C:\Users\MyCoolName\Documents\MySourceCodes` would lead the CMD to run commands on that folder.
    - Run `git clone https://github.com/toffeecaramel/FNF-MoonEngine` to clone the repository.
    - Then, run `cd FNF-MoonEngine` to open the repository.

## Step 3: Installing the dependencies.
* Now, It's time to install the dependencies. (A.K.A the libraries.)
    - If your CMD is open, just type in `setup.bat`.
    - Or, if you want to, you can just open `setup.bat`.
    - Now, all you need to do is wait/interact with it when it asks you to do so.

## Step 4: Compiling the game.
* Quick reminder, you need to do this for any code changes you do, and it only takes long to compile for the first time since the engine needs to fetch all the libraries you installed.
    - Open the cmd on the game's folder, then all you need to do is type `lime test windows`.
    - And then you just wait! :3
